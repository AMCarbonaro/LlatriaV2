# Create Custom Search Engine - Step by Step

## Step 1: Go to Custom Search

Open: https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/

## Step 2: Create New Search Engine

1. Click the **"Add"** button (usually at the top or in the center)
2. You'll see a form to create a new search engine

## Step 3: Fill in the Form

**Sites to search:**
- Enter: `*` (just an asterisk/star character)
- This tells Google to search the entire web, not just specific sites

**Name of the search engine:**
- Enter: `Llatria Shopping Search` (or any name you prefer)

**Language:**
- Select: `English (United States)` or your preferred language

**What to search:**
- Select: `Search the entire web` (if available as an option)

## Step 4: Create

Click the **"Create"** button

## Step 5: Configure to Search Entire Web

After creation, you'll see your search engine listed. 

1. Click on your search engine name to open it
2. Go to **"Setup"** tab (or **"Control Panel"**)
3. Click on **"Basics"** (or **"Search settings"**)
4. Look for **"Search the entire web"** option
5. **Enable it** (toggle it on or check the box)
6. Click **"Save"** or **"Update"**

## Step 6: Get Your Search Engine ID

1. Still in the **"Setup"** or **"Control Panel"** section
2. Look for **"Search engine ID"** or **"cx"** parameter
3. It will look like: `012345678901234567890:abcdefghijk`
4. **Copy this ID** - you'll need it for the backend

## Step 7: Test (Optional)

You can test your search engine by:
1. Going to the **"Public URL"** section
2. Clicking the test link
3. Searching for something like "iPhone 13 price"
4. You should see search results

## What to Send Me

Once you have the **Search Engine ID**, send it to me and I'll add it to your backend configuration!

The ID will look something like:
- `012345678901234567890:abcdefghijk`
- Or it might be shorter/longer, but will have numbers and letters separated by a colon

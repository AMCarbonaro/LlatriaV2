# Billing Enabled! ✅

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for billing to propagate to Google's systems
2. **Try uploading an image again** - AI recognition should now work
3. The item will be created with AI-generated data:
   - Title/description
   - Suggested price
   - Category
   - Condition

## What to Expect

When you upload an image now:
1. Image compresses (should be ~60-150 KB)
2. Item is created in database
3. AI processes the image (this should work now!)
4. Item is updated with AI data
5. You'll see the full listing with AI-generated details

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still get billing errors after 3-5 minutes:
1. Check Google Cloud Console → Billing to confirm it's linked
2. Make sure the correct project is selected
3. Try refreshing the app

## Test It Now

Go ahead and upload another image - it should work! 🎉

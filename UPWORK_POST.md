# Upwork Job Posting: Complete Multi-Platform Inventory Management Application

We have a partially completed inventory management application for pawn shops that needs to be finished and deployed to production. The application consists of a Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL database, a React/Electron desktop application, a React Native mobile app, and a React website. The core infrastructure is in place with authentication, inventory management, and basic API integrations working locally, but several critical features remain incomplete and the application needs to be deployed to AWS.

The Facebook Marketplace automation using Electron is partially implemented but requires completion. Currently, the automation opens Facebook Marketplace and fills form fields, but image upload and final publishing still require manual user intervention. This needs to be fully automated or at least streamlined to minimize manual steps. The eBay API integration has the service layer built with OAuth flow structure, but the settings page connection flow is currently mocked and needs to be connected to the real eBay OAuth endpoints. The platform posting functionality exists in the backend but needs thorough testing and error handling refinement.

The settings pages for Facebook, eBay, and store setup are currently using simulated connections and mock data. The Facebook and eBay connection flows need to be replaced with real OAuth implementations that properly store credentials in the database and handle token refresh. The store setup functionality for creating custom subdomain websites is simulated and needs a complete backend implementation that handles subdomain creation, DNS configuration, and website generation. The account settings page also needs to be connected to real backend endpoints for saving store name, email, and phone information.

The backend application is currently running locally with Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, but it needs to be fully deployed to AWS. This includes setting up RDS PostgreSQL database, deploying the Express API to ECS or EC2, configuring S3 for image storage with CloudFront CDN, setting up ElastiCache for Redis if needed, configuring Application Load Balancer, setting up proper security groups and IAM roles, implementing AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials, and establishing monitoring with CloudWatch. The application also needs proper environment configuration for production, database migration scripts for deployment, and CI/CD pipeline setup.

The mobile application has basic inventory viewing functionality but is missing many features that exist in the desktop version. The mobile app needs search functionality, filtering options, sorting capabilities, bulk operations interface, grid view toggle, advanced filters modal, toast notifications UI, and proper integration with the backend API instead of using mock services. The desktop application is more complete but may need refinement based on testing the completed integrations.

A critical priority for this project is getting the Google API integration working correctly and accurately. The Google Vision API and Google Custom Search API are already integrated at a basic level, but the image recognition and product search functionality needs significant refinement to ensure accurate results. The Google Lens-like functionality using Vision API must correctly identify items from photos, extract accurate product names, brands, models, and specifications. The search functionality using Custom Search API needs to return relevant product matches with accurate pricing information for market comparison. This is a core feature of the application as pawn shop owners rely on accurate item identification and market pricing to make informed decisions. The developer must thoroughly test and refine the image recognition algorithms, improve the product matching logic, ensure search queries return relevant results, and optimize the data extraction from API responses to provide reliable and accurate information to users.

The project uses TypeScript throughout, Prisma for database management, Zustand for state management, and has Google Vision API and Google Custom Search API already integrated. The codebase is well-structured with separate services, controllers, and routes. The developer will need to complete the remaining integrations, connect all the mocked functionality to real backend endpoints, deploy everything to AWS, and ensure all three applications (desktop, mobile, website) work seamlessly together in production. Experience with Electron automation, OAuth flows, AWS deployment, React Native, and Google Cloud APIs is essential for this project.

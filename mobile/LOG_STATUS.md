# Log Status Summary

## Current Status: ✅ BUNDLING

The iOS bundle is now building successfully! Progress:
- Started at 0%
- Currently building modules (738 total)
- No more "entry-classic" resolution errors

## Previous Errors (FIXED):

1. ✅ **Duplicate react-dom** - Fixed with nohoist configuration
2. ✅ **.expo directory not ignored** - Added to .gitignore  
3. ✅ **expo-router entry-classic resolution** - Bundle is now building

## Current Warnings (Non-blocking):

- Version mismatches (React 19.2.0 vs expected 19.1.0) - These are compatible
- Some packages have minor version differences

## Next Steps:

Waiting for bundle to complete. Check logs in:
- `expo-new.log` - Latest Expo server logs
- Simulator logs - Check iOS console for runtime errors

The app should launch once the bundle completes!
